	| Looking back into the Bronze Age when modern handicrafts were born, we have chosen to soak up our interiors with original and native handicrafts. This is why, we travel hundreds of miles to greet the skilful hands which produce pure and original handicrafts in untouched areas of Pakistan.

Thinking about the people living in less privileged areas and working with pierced fingers for decorating your homes, we find dignity and self-sufficiency more than desire and need in the handicrafts made by them.
